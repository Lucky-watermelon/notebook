Dear XXX ,

Thanks for sharing the great work.

I'd like to train COPLE-Net with the 70 noisy-label cases.
Following is the config info

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Hou



Hi Guotai, 

Thanks for your quick reply very much.

I add crop in "train_transform", and the OOM problem is solved.

However, a new error occurred:



It seems that I need to reformat the 3D nii files to 2D slices before training, right?

Sorry for so many "stupid" questions. Thanks for your time very much.

Best regards,
Hou
